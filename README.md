# LocalChat
A Local Chatting website that doesn't need internet!

# How to install
IDK why you would want to do this but anyway here's how.

While you still have Internet, do this:
1. Clone the repository into a new folder
2. In the folder, open a new terminal.
3. run `npm install`.

That's the whole thing installed.
Once you are offline and would like to chat with someone, it's a bit more complicated.

# Offline Steps:
1. Create a hotspot on your laptop that has NodeJS and this project installed.
2. Connect all the clients you want to chat with to your hotspot.
3. Go to the folder where this program is installed, and open a terminal.
4. In that terminal, run `ipconfig`. Find the IP address under the adapter that has something to do with hotspot or Wi-Fi, and remember that. That will be the URL that you input on your clients devices.
5. Finally, run `node ./src/app.js`.

# Updated Offline Steps
 1. Instead of opening the terminal and running `node ./src/app.js`, just run the .exe file.

That's it! Now you can navigate to that IP address that you got in step 4, and begin chatting.

# Usecases
I made this so that I could talk to my friends on the plane while not having access to the internet.
Create a pull request and add some more here and I'll probably accept it within a year :P

# Enjoy!
